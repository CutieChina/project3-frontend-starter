## Description
Our app is a open community forum. In this forum you can add a message to any thread and delete your message. We have four forums and in each forum there are threads related to the forum that the user picks. When the user clicks on the forum they will be able to post anything they want that is related to the subject. 

## If we had more time:
- We would have added a button to create a new thread.
