## If we had more time:
- We would aim to have a login feature for users to create their own profile.
- We would have added a feature for users to create a new thread. 
- We would set a feature to show the name of the user who created the thread.
- We would set a feature to show the name of the user who submited the post.
- We would aim to do more with the layout and the desin of the page(s)
